# TubeTopMovies
React Project

### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION

My app currently carries a working title of "Tube Top".  There are many movie apps out there (and at this point a seemingly infinite number of movies), so I've decided to try to make an app with the more discerning viewer in mind.  

Trying to sift through heaps of movies in order to find a quality flick can be exhausting.  The goal of "Tube Top" is to simplify the search for a film worthy of your time.  Users will only be presented with titles that have a minimum critical rating of 70/100, which will provide a generous listing of movies that have generally been deemed as watchable.  A second listing option will be more selective, presenting only the titles rated 80/100 and above, and thus providing the highest likelihood of viewer approval.

Future goals include adding filtering options for more specific interests, such as results by genre and date of release.

### MVP USER STORIES

* As a user, I want to browse films of a minimum rating to help me quickly select a movie I am more likely to enjoy.  
* As a user, I want the option to view a more selective film listing if I find the lower tier is cluttered with mediocre films
* As a user, I want to see an individual title's rating

### POST MVP STRETCH GOALS

* As a user, I want the option to read an "About" description that explains the reasoning behind filtering titles at certain rating points
* As a user, I want the option to order all titles from highest to lowest rating and vice versa
* As a user, I want to view well-rated movies within specific genres and/or decades of release
* As a user, I want to additionally view the popularity score of the titles, and be able to filter by popularity
